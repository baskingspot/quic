## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `varint` decodes and writes the RFC 9000 §16 variable-length integer, in all
  four widths. `decodeMinimal` rejects a width wider than the value needs, which
  is what the frame type requires.
- `Cursor` and `Writer` read and write caller-owned bytes at a `u32`
  position.
- `packet` reads and writes every RFC 9000 §17 header: Initial, 0-RTT,
  Handshake, Retry, Version Negotiation, and the short header.
  `packet.parseInvariant` reads the connection IDs and the version from a long
  header without keys, which is what answering with version negotiation needs.
- `packet_number` picks the width of the truncated packet number and recovers
  it at the receiver (§17.1).
